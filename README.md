# roktopost
An R wrapper for the Oktopost social media management API

This R wrapper only covers statistics and authentication; it does not allow you to create or manage campaigns. I developed it for use in my work at Snowplow; feel free to fork it an add additional functionality if you wish, or introduce a pull request to cover other functions.

You can use this API to get information on social posts, messages, campaigns, profiles, and followers.
